# OpenNutriLab

Status: ðŸš§ Under Construction

OpenNutriLab is a web application built with Django aiming to provide interactive tools for nutrition tracking and meal planning. 

This project is currently in its **MVP (Minimum Viable Product) development phase**. The focus is on building a simplified, functional version of the application with only the essential features needed to validate ideas and gather user feedback. Please note that features, database schemas, and APIs may change frequently as the project evolves based on testing and user input.
